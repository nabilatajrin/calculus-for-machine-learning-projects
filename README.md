#### The SandpitPart01
The Sandbox will build an understanding of what the Jacobian is, and how this can be used to find the minimum of a function.<br>

#### The SandpitPart02
In this notebook, we'll explore some more sandpit scenarios in order to build on your intuition of the Jacobian and gradient descent. We'll look at some harder scenarios and some of the pitfalls and limitations of following the gradient down contours in order to find the minimum of a function. <br>
