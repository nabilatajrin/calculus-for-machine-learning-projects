This repository contains some projects using calculus.

#### Backpropagation
In this assignment, we will train a neural network to draw a curve by implementing backpropagation by the chain rule to calculate Jacobians of the cost function. The neural network will then be trained using a (pre-implemented) stochastic steepest descent method, and will draw a series of curves to show the progress of the training.<br>

#### The Sandpit Part 01
The Sandbox will build an understanding of what the Jacobian is, and how this can be used to find the minimum of a function.<br>

#### The Sandpit Part 02
In this notebook, we'll explore some more sandpit scenarios in order to build on your intuition of the Jacobian and gradient descent. We'll look at some harder scenarios and some of the pitfalls and limitations of following the gradient down contours in order to find the minimum of a function. <br>
